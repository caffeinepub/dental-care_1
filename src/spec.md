# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable the clinic to accept appointments by setting the clinic status to permanently open.

**Planned changes:**
- Set the clinic status to open in the backend so appointments can be accepted at all times
- Update the frontend to remove the "Clinic Currently Closed" message and enable appointment booking functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see that the clinic is open and accepting appointments, and they will be able to successfully submit appointment booking requests through the form.
