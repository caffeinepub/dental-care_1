# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify admin panel authentication to use only username and password without verification steps.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any verification or multi-step authentication process from admin login
- Ensure login form displays only username and password fields
- Grant admin access immediately upon successful credential validation (username: 6352174912, password: 63521)
- Streamline authentication to complete in a single step with immediate feedback

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can log in directly with username and password only, accessing the admin panel immediately without any verification steps or additional processing screens.
