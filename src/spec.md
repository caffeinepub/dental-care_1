# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update admin authentication credentials and implement a sign-in flow that protects the admin panel.

**Planned changes:**
- Change admin login credentials to username 'USER' and password 'PASS'
- Add authentication requirement before accessing admin panel
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login form
- Display all appointments and settings in admin panel after successful login

**User-visible outcome:** Admin must sign in with new credentials (USER/PASS) to access the admin panel, where they can view all appointments and settings.
