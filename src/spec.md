# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Relocate admin panel access from main navigation to a subtle, fixed bottom-right corner position.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove admin panel link from the main header navigation
- Add a small, discreet button/icon fixed in the bottom-right corner of all pages
- Style the corner element with low visual prominence (reduced opacity, small size)
- Make the element slightly more visible on hover for interactivity feedback
- Ensure the corner element remains accessible across all viewport sizes

**User-visible outcome:** Admin panel access is moved to a subtle bottom-right corner position that is visible but not prominent, while main visitors see a cleaner navigation without the admin link.
