# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add interactive expandable service cards to the ServicesSection component with detailed information for each dental service.

**Planned changes:**
- Convert existing service cards to accordion/expandable pattern with click-to-expand functionality
- Add detailed content (procedure, benefits, time/longevity, CTA) for all six services in Hindi/Urdu
- Implement smooth expand/collapse animations with single-card-open-at-a-time behavior
- Add CTA buttons in each expanded section that navigate to the booking page
- Ensure consistent content structure across all services (Dental Check-up & Cleaning, Root Canal Treatment, Dental Implants, Teeth Whitening, Braces & Aligners, Pediatric Dentistry)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on any service card to reveal detailed information about the procedure, benefits, and timing, with a prominent call-to-action button to book an appointment. Only one service expands at a time, creating a clean, organized browsing experience.
