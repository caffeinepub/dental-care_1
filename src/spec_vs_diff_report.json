  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. The backend now returns a permanently open clinic status (REQ-1), and the frontend displays this status and enables appointment booking (REQ-2). The migration removes the old clinicStatus field, backend methods now always return true for clinic open status, and frontend components properly display the open status with appropriate UI elements.",

      "description": "Migration module added to handle state transition from old actor structure with clinicStatus field to new actor structure without it",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest constraints specify 'Do not remove the clinic status management functionality from the admin panel', but the migration.mo file removes the clinicStatus field entirely from the actor state. While the backend still exposes getClinicOpen() and getShouldBeOpen() query functions, the actual stateful clinic status management capability has been removed.",
