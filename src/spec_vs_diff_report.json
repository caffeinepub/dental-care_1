  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all requested expandable service card requirements. The ServicesSection component has been converted to use an accordion pattern with all six services having detailed expandable content in Hindi/Urdu, including procedures, benefits, and CTA buttons that navigate to the booking page. The accordion behavior, smooth animations, and consistent structure across all services are implemented as specified.",
